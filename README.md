# shiny-annotation
This project is designed to interactively visualize scRANseq datastes processed with Seurat. In this repository we have the code to the Shiny App which can be accessed in the following [link](https://singlecellgenomics-cnag-crg.shinyapps.io/Annotation/) as well as the function [seurat2shiny](https://github.com/Single-Cell-Genomics-Group-CNAG-CRG/shiny-annotation/blob/master/seurat2shiny.R) aimed to extract the required RDS objects from the original Seurat object.
